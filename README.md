# ARShootingApp
Concepts shown in this Project:

1. Project Architecture
2. Real World ARKit experience 
3. Physics Concepts of Collision of two objects in Real Word
4. Animation 

Run the App on Device because the simulator does not open the camera and cannot simulate the real world AR Experience.


**ISSUES ADDRESSED WHEN RUNNING THE APP ON DEVICE**

If the project shows signing errors, then you can do one of the following:

1. Select the Project in Project Navigator> Select Target > Signing and Capabilities > Change the Team to Personal Team

OR

2. (This is more of a Hack than the solution if you have reached maximum App ID Limit) - Copy and Pase the bundle Identifier of the App which can still be installed and run in your device
